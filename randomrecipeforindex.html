        Assembling and Cooking Aloo Parathas:
        
            Divide the dough into equal-sized balls.
            Take one dough ball and roll it into a small disc using a rolling pin.
            Place a portion of the potato filling in the center of the disc.
            Bring the edges of the dough together to cover the filling, forming a ball again.
            Gently flatten the stuffed dough ball with your hands.
            Roll it out carefully into a paratha, being cautious not to let the filling spill out.
            Heat a tawa or skillet over medium-high heat.
            Place the rolled-out paratha on the hot tawa.
            Cook until small bubbles start forming on the surface, then flip it over.
            Apply ghee or oil on both sides and cook until golden brown spots appear and the paratha is cooked through.
            Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling.</li></ol></ul></ul>
